= Prerequisites

You need at least the following:

* Gradle 5.2 or higher
* JDK 8 or higher (for running Gradle)

* Helm CLI (3.+)
+
This plugin delegates all `helm` commands to a locally installed Helm CLI. See
https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm[Installing Helm] in the Helm documentation for installation
instructions on various systems.
+
Starting with version 0.5.0, the plugin requires Helm 3. However, the chart API version `v1` is still
supported by Helm 3, and also by the plugin. (The main difference between `v1` and `v2` is that `v1` declares
chart dependencies in a file called `requirements.yaml`, whereas in `v2` the dependencies are declared
directly in the `Chart.yaml` file.)
+
INFO: Delegating to the Helm CLI decouples the plugin release cycle from the Helm release cycle, but it also
means that some features offered by the plugin may not be available in the CLI and vice versa.
