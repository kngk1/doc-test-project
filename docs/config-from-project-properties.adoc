= Configuration from Project Properties

Many settings can be configured by Gradle
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties[project properties]
instead of specifying them in the DSL. This has the advantage that you can pass them on the command line
(using `-P` switches) or a local `~/gradle.properties` file to account for different build environments.
In addition, such properties are automatically inherited by subprojects.

Some of these properties allow evaluation as a Groovy `GString`, so that you can do things like
`-Phelm.executable=$rootDir/helm/bin/helm3` (but the dollar signs may need to be escaped so the shell does not
treat them as environment variables). GStrings will be evaluated in the context of each project.

In general, the name of the project property corresponds to the path of the property in the DSL,
e.g. `helm.executable`.

NOTE: Properties set explicitly in your Gradle script have precedence over properties from the command line
or `gradle.properties` file, so it may be better to put them in `gradle.properties` in the first place, to
allow for easier overriding.

== Basic Helm Properties

[cols="3,4,1"]
|===
| Property | Description | GString

| `helm.executable`
| Path to the Helm CLI executable. The `PATH` variable is taken into account, so this

| Enable verbose output from the Helm CLI.
|

| `helm.kubeContext`
| Name of the kubeconfig context to use.
|

| `helm.kubeConfig`
| Path to the Kubernetes configuration file.
| icon:check[]

| `helm.remoteTimeout`
| Time to wait for an individual Kubernetes operation (like Jobs or hooks).

May be specified in Helm format (e.g. `3m30s`), in ISO format (e.g. `PT3M30S`) or as a plain number indicating the
number of seconds (e.g. `210`).

| `helm.namespace`
| The target namespace for Kubernetes operations.
|

| `helm.outputDir`
| The base output directory for charts; defaults to `$buildDir/helm/charts`.
| icon:check[]

| `helm.tmpDir`

| icon:check[]

| `helm.xdgDataHome`
| Base directory for storing data. Corresponds to the `XDG_DATA_HOME` environment variable.
  Defaults to `$buildDir/helm/data`.
| icon:check[]

  Defaults to `$buildDir/helm/config`.
| icon:check[]

| `helm.xdgCacheHome`
| Base directory for storing data. Corresponds to the `XDG_CACHE_HOME` environment variable.
  Defaults to `$rootDir/.gradle/helm/cache`.
| icon:check[]

== Repositories

You can configure repositories entirely from Gradle properties -- just the presence of a set of
`helm.repositories.<name>.<xyz>` properties will automatically create a corresponding repository.

| The URL of the repository.

| `helm.repository.<name>.credentials.username`
| Username for password-based authentication.

| `helm.repository.<name>.credentials.password`
| Password for password-based authentication.

| `helm.repository.<name>.credentials.certificateFile`
| Client certificate file for certificate authentication.

| `helm.repository.<name>.credentials.keyFile`
| Private key file for certificate authentication.
